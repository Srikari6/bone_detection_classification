# bone_detection_classification

In this paper, we introduce a bone detection and 
classification method utilizing deep learning methodology. We
used three different models namely, MobileNet,
and a customvit model, trained them on the bone x-ray images
dataset and evaluated. MobileNet is well known for being light
on resources, and produced a training accuracy of 90.06% and
the development accuracy was 85.79882%. The tailor-
made customvit model for the bone classification and detection
task reached an overall training accuracy of 98.86% and the
development accuracy was 95.75%. Through discussion of these
model results we hope to derive recommendations on the best
approach for accurate and efficient detection/ classification of
bone in medical imaging.
